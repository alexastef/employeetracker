## Contributing  
Feel free to contribute. Most of these functions just work well enough to complete the task, so the code could definitely use some refactoring and cleaning up. 

For future development: 
- Adding department managers
- Preventing managers from duplicating when user views by managers
- Different ways to view and group employees
